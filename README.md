# Data Mining Project 1

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive data mining project. The project involves various tasks such as data loading, data cleaning, univariate and multivariate analysis, correlation analysis, binning techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and creating and analyzing data cubes. It also includes performing classification using k-nearest neighbors.

## Skills Used
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
- Correlation Analysis
- Binning Techniques
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Creating and Analyzing Data Cubes
- k-Nearest Neighbors Classification

## Contents
1. **Loading the Wine Dataset:**
   - Load and examine the wine dataset.
   - Identify and analyze the categorical feature.

2. **Univariate and Multivariate Summaries:**
   - Compute and visualize univariate summaries (histograms, box plots).
   - Compute and visualize multivariate summaries (correlation matrix, pair plots).

3. **Grouping and Median Calculation:**
   - Group observations by categorical feature and compute medians for numerical features.

4. **Scatter Plot and Correlation Analysis:**
   - Create scatter plots for pairs of features with highest correlation.
   - Compute and interpret correlation coefficients.

5. **Binning Techniques:**
   - Apply equal-frequency binning and smoothing by bin boundaries on sales data.

6. **Data Cleaning and Encoding:**
   - Load and clean country-income.csv.
   - Replace NaN values and convert categorical features to numerical.

7. **Scatter Plot and Correlation for Shoe Size Data:**
   - Analyze scatter plots and correlations for shoe size vs height for male and female subjects.

8. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Perform PCA on the wine dataset.
   - Visualize the data along principal components and interpret the results.

9. **Data Cube Creation and Analysis:**
   - Load country-income.csv and create a data cube.
   - Define dimensions, measures, and aggregate functions.
   - Produce aggregate results for the data cube.

10. **k-Nearest Neighbors Classification:**
    - Classify observations using 1-nearest neighbor based on Euclidean distance.
